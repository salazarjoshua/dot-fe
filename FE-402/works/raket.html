                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are artists-for-hire communities in apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. They follow a
                        system where artists and clients use tags when posting. <b>#ForHire</b> is
                        used by artists to show their
                        works and general idea of their pricing, whereas, <b>#LookingFor</b> is
                        used by clients with specific
                        requests. Client's posts includes details and/or example of what they're looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently, I decided to look for a Filipino artist online. I have browsed through several apps,
                        however, the apps mentioned are not easy to use as they do not have the capability to filter search
                        based on art styles and/or by price range.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
                    <p>
                        Despite having artists-for-hire communities in several apps that help connecting artists and
                        clients, the platform is not really designed for them making it challenging to use.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>USERS & AUDIENCE</h3>
                    <p>
                        The target users of Raket are local artists and people who are looking to make a custom art. These
                        people are heavy users of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>WHAT I DID</h3>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research</li>
                        <li>UX Design</li>
                        <li>UI Design</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>COMPETITOR RESEARCH</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fiverr is the world's largest freelance service marketplace available, however, I found out that the
                        majority of local artists utilize applications such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to promote
                        their artworks and connect with clients. They also use popular local credit cards, G-Cash, and
                        Paymaya as payment methods, and PayPal to accommodate international clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I analyzed the different qualities of the above-mentioned apps and identified the features that I
                        can improve, implement, and avoid.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3>SOME TERMS USED</h3>
                    <p>Think of this as a marketplace like Amazon where there are sellers, buyers, and items.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Artists</b> - They are the sellers</li>
                        <li><b>Clients</b> - They are the buyers</li>
                        <li><b>Raket(s)</b> - The name of the app. It is also the service (item) offered by the
                            artists (sellers)</li>
                        <li><b>Local</b> - Filipino or Philippines</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <p><em><small><b>Note:</b> I am not affiliated with Raket.ph by
                                Fullstack HQ. I already thought of the name and the idea of what the app would be before
                                seeing
                                their website.</small></em></p>

                        Since local artists are heavy users of social media, I want the users to think that they are on
                        another social media app.

                    <h2>Commission Details</h2>
                    <p>
                        Offered packages are different from artist to artist. Some may offer sketches to full colored
                        illustrations. Some may offer a bust to a full body. But one thing I noticed is packages always have
                        different prices. With this in mind, I labeled the packages by price instead of names such as Basic,
                        Standard and Premium. I believe this is also more convenient to users since this is a marketplace
                        afterall and users are likely to have a budget.

                    <p>The majority of local artists use local credit/debit cards and e-wallets such as <strong>GCash,
                            PayMaya, and Paypal</strong>. I included all of this to payment method to accomplish financial
                        transactions
                        faster.</p>

                    <p>
                        Searching in apps like Facebook and Twitter is challenging as users have to search the exact phrase
                        or word.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that each person has their own preference in art styles. Filtering search based on art
                        styles, inclusions, and price is made easy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, there is a system used in artists-for-hire communities. I enhanced the said
                        system separating the <b>#ForHire</b></a> (Rakets) and <b>#LookingFor</b> (Hiring Artists) sections in order to reduce
                        clutter and improve navigation.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I added a feature where artists can send offers to clients inside the conversation.
                        This will make the order customizable to accommodate specific requests from clients.

                        comfortable about moving forward with them, I added a Portfolio tab so artists can showcase their
                        previous works. In addition, a feedback section will allow them to gain more trust.
